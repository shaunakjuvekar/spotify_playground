There are two mini-projects here
1. Exploratory data analysis of a Spotify dataset
2. A Music Recommendation System

# Exploratory data analysis
Sample analysis steps and operations include :-
1. Data cleaning
2. Correlations between variables
3. Durations of songs based on genre
4. Top genres (based on popularity)

# Music Recommendation System
1. Setup Spotify developer account and get access token
2. Get all the tracks from a playlist id using the access token and store it in a pandas dataframe
3. Calculate weighted popularity
4. Normalize features
5. Write content based recommendations
6. Get hybrid recommendations based on content and weighted popularity
